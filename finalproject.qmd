# Background: Historical Gas Emissions & Economic Growth

One of the most urgent issues facing the world today is climate change,
with greenhouse gas emissions playing a critical role in driving global
warming. Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and
changing climate patterns are the results of the buildup of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere, which is mostly caused by human activities such
the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial operations.

Historically, economic growth has been **positively correlated with
emissions**, with if GDP increases, so does energy consumption and
emissions. However, recent trends suggest that some **high-income
nations** have successfully **reduced emissions while maintaining
economic growth**, suggesting a possible **decoupling** between GDP and
emissions.

This report analyzes **historical GHG emissions data from Climate
Watch**, covering the period from **1990 to 2019** for **195** countries
and regions. The dataset provides insights into emissions trends across
various geographical areas and economic circumstances, allowing for a
more in-depth knowledge of how emissions have changed over time. The
goal of this report is to explore these trends, compare emissions across
areas, and evaluate countries' progress toward lowering their carbon
footprint. This data will be studied alongside **GDP per capita data**
and **Population data** from **the World Bank**, providing a
comprehensive view of **economic factors influencing emissions trends**.
This analysis intends to add to the ongoing discussion about climate
policy and mitigation measures by analyzing emission trends along with
GDP and key drivers.

## The Challenge: Balancing Emissions Reduction with Economic Growth

Achieving worldwide climate goals, such as those established by the
Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep the increase in global temperature
to well below 2Â°C over pre-industrial levels, depends on addressing
these emissions. However, this effort must balance economic development,
as countries at different income levels face unique challenges in
reducing their carbon footprint.

Countries at different income levels face **unique challenges** in
lowering their carbon footprint while sustaining economic growth.

-   **Developed nations** may have the financial and technological
    capacity to **invest in clean energy** and transition toward
    low-carbon economies.

-   **Developing nations**, however, may rely on fossil fuels for
    **economic expansion**, leading to increased emissions.

In order to make informed decisions on sustainability initiatives,
governments, researchers, and the general public must have a thorough
understanding of emissions statistics. The success of climate policy,
inequalities in accountability and impact, and the basis for future
climate action can all be uncovered by a thorough examination of past
emissions trends.

## Gas Emissions Data

The data consist of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions measured for
different countries and regions worldwide, spanning the years 1990 to
2019. GHG emissions contribute to climate change, and analyzing
long-term trends helps assess mitigation efforts and policy
effectiveness. The dataset records emissions values in million metric
tons of $CO_2$ equivalent($MtCO_2e$) and categorizes emissions across
different sectors.

-   **Observational units**: Annual GHG emissions ($MtCO_2e$) per
    country or region.

-   **Variables**: Year, Country, Data Source, Sector, Gas, and Unit

-   **Time coverage**: 1990-2019 (30 years).

-   **Geographic coverage**: 195 countries and global totals.

The table below provides variable descriptions and units for each column
in our dataframe.

| Variable | Description | Units |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Year | Year of recorded emissions | Numeric; Years |
| Country | Country where emissions were recorded | Categorical; Country Name |
| Data Source | Source of the emissions data | Categorical; Source Name |
| Sector | Sector classification of emission (LUCF = Land Use Change and Forestry) | Categorical; Sector Name |
| Gas | Type of greenhouse gas measured (GHG = Greenhouse Gas) | Categorical; Gas Type |
| Unit | Measurement unit for emissions values | Numeric; Million metric tons of $CO_2$ equivalent ($MtCO_2e$) |

: Data Description Table

## GDP Per Capita Data (inc. Population)

To assess the impact of **economic growth on emissions**, we incorporate
**GDP per capita** data from the **World Bank**. This dataset provides
annual **GDP per capita values** for **195 countries and regions**,
expressed in **current US dollars**.

-   **Observational Unit:** Countries

-   **Time Coverage:** 1961-2019

-   **Geographic Coverage:** 264 countries and global totals

-   **Measurement Unit:** US dollars (current prices)

-   **Relevance to Emissions:** Higher GDP per capita often correlates
    with **higher energy consumption**, but may also indicate
    investments in **clean energy and sustainability measures**.

| Variable | Description | Units |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Year | Year in which GDP per capita was recorded | Numeric; Years |
| Country | Name of the country where GDP was recorded | Categorical; Country Name |
| GDP per capita | Gross Domestic Product per capita in current US Dollars | Numeric; USD |
| Country Code | Standardized three-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code representing each country | Categorical; ISO Alpha-3 Code |
| Population | The total population per year per capita | Numeric; Population Count |

## The Question of Interest

The key research question that guides this analysis is: ***How have
global and country-specific GHG emissions changed over time, and what
variables may have influenced these trends?***

This question is motivated by the increasing urgency of addressing
climate change and the necessity for a data-driven strategy to assessing
emissions reduction initiatives. By analyzing emissions data over a
30-year period, this study aims to identify:

-   Overall trends in global GHG emissions.

-   Regional variations and differences between developed and developing
    nations.

-   The role of economic growth, policy changes, and energy transitions
    in shaping emissions trends.

Finding important trends and plausible causes for the observed emissions
trends would be necessary to provide a satisfying response to this
topic. This includes evaluating whether certain policies have been
effective in curbing emissions, determining which countries or regions
have made significant progress, and understanding the ways in which
industrial and economic factors affect GHG emissions. Additionally, the
findings will help inform discussions on future mitigation strategies
and areas where further research or policy intervention may be needed.

# Data Cleaning

Before conducting our analysis, we need to **clean and restructure the
dataset**. Our data is **not in a tidy format**, as years are stored as
**column headers** instead of a **single variable**. The cell below
imports our Historical Emissions data.

To ensure proper analysis, we **tidy the dataset** by:

1.  **Reshaping it into long format** (moving years from columns to
    rows).

2.  **Ensuring Year is stored as a numeric variable**.

3.  **Handling missing values** appropriately.

    -   Our GDP dataset contains a significant number of missing values
        in the GDP per capita.To preserve data integrity and avoid
        unnecessary loss of information, we will apply mean imputation,
        replacing missing values with the mean GDP per capita for each
        country. In regards to our Population and Emissions dataset, we
        will be dropping missing NA's for simplicity.

Our dataset has been tidied, and no longer contains any missing NA's. We
can now move onto our **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) section.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Global Emissions & GDP Overtime

To understand long-term trends in greenhouse gas output, we first
examine global emissions from 1990 to 2019. The dataset includes a
special "World" entry, which aggregates emissions across all reporting
countries and sectors. This allows us to visualize the overall trend of
human impact on the atmosphere over the past three decades. Also, by
integrating global GDP data and scaling both metrics by total
population, we reveal how demographic expansion and economic growth have
jointly shaped the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions over time.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Global Emissions Trend Over Time (World)
# Summarize global data
global_emissions_summary <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country == "World") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    Emissions = sum(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE),
    Population = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(Pop_Billions = Population / 1e9)

# Plot: Emissions over time, point size = population
global_emissions_chart <- ggplot(global_emissions_summary, aes(x = Year, y = Emissions)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Pop_Billions), color = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.6) +

    x = "Year",
    y = "Emissions (MtCO2e)"
  ) +

    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.3, face = "bold"),
    # legend.position = "right"
  )

global_gdp_summary <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country == "World") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    GDP = sum(gdp, na.rm = TRUE),
    Population = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Pop_Billions = Population / 1e9)

# Plot: GDP over time, point size = population
global_gdp_chart <- ggplot(global_gdp_summary, aes(x = Year, y = GDP)) +
  geom_line(color = "firebrick", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Pop_Billions), color = "firebrick", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population (Billions)", range = c(1.5, 6)) +
  labs(
    title = "Global GDP Over Time (1990â2019)",

  ) +

    # legend.position = "right"
  )
```

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
global_emissions_chart + global_gdp_chart
```

Global greenhouse gas emissions and GDP have both shown a steady and
significant increase from 1990 to 2019. Emissions rose gradually in the
early 1990s, followed by a sharp acceleration after 2000, closely
reflecting patterns of economic growth during the same period. This rise
was largely driven by the rapid industrial expansion of countries such
as China and India which experienced significant industrial growth,
leading to a surge in energy consumption, much of it powered by fossil
fuels. While some fluctuations in emissions growth can be observed, such
as temporary slowdowns during economic recessions or during brief
periods of policy intervention, the overall pattern remains one of
continued growth.

A slowdown in the rate of emissions growth appears in the most recent
years, possibly reflecting the increasing adoption of renewable energy
sources, improvements in energy efficiency, and stricter environmental
policies in some parts of the world. However, emissions remain
significantly higher than they were in previous decades, underscoring
the fact that global efforts to curb emissions have not yet resulted in
a meaningful reduction in overall greenhouse gas output.

The key takeaway from this trend is that economic and industrial growth
remain primary drivers of emissions, and while policies and cleaner
technologies may help slow the rate of increase, they have not yet led
to a global-scale reduction. Future emissions reductions will likely
depend on the successful implementation of more ambitious climate
policies, accelerated investments in renewable energy, and international
cooperation to enforce emissions limits more effectively.

### Top 5 Contributors to Overall Global Emissions since 1990

Rather than focusing on a single year, we examined which countries
repeatedly ranked among the top 5 greenhouse gas emitters from 1990 to
2019. This long-term view reveals which nations have played the most
significant roles in driving emissions over the past three decades.
China and the United States appear most frequently, with India, Russia,
and the European Union also showing up regularly.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height= 5}
#Filter out top 5 overall emitters
top5_counts <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Year >= 1990, Year <= 2019, Country != "World") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = Emissions, n = 5, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  count(Country, name = "Top5_Appearances") %>%
  arrange(desc(Top5_Appearances))

country_order <- top5_counts %>%
  # arrange(desc(Top5_Appearances)) %>%
  pull(Country)

# Apply this order to both plots
top5_counts <- top5_counts %>%
  mutate(Country = factor(Country, levels = country_order))

emissions_top5 <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_order) %>%
  mutate(Country = factor(Country, levels = country_order))

# Line chart
top5_chart <- emissions_top5 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Emissions, color = Country)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  labs(title = "GHG Trends: Top 5 Overall Emitters (1990â2019)", 
       x = "Year", y = "Emissions (MtCO2e)") +
  theme_minimal() 
# Bar chart
count_chart <- top5_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Top5_Appearances, fill = Country)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 5 Emissions Ranking (1990â2019)",
       x = "Country", y = "Number of Appearances in Top 5") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Combine with patchwork
count_chart/ top5_chart

```

From 1990 to 2019, the United States, China, and Brazil have been the
most consistent contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, each
appearing in the top 5 every single year. Meanwhile, India and Indonesia
have steadily risen in the rankings, with frequent appearances in the
top 5.

Chinaâs emissions rose sharply after 2000, making it the dominant global
emitter. The U.S. remained relatively stable, whereas Indonesia balanced
between increasing and decreasing. Indiaâs emissions steadily increased,
reflecting economic growth, while Brazil saw a modest rise with a
notable drop around 2010.

### Developed Countries vs. Developing Countries

To explore differences in emissions behavior, we compare greenhouse gas
emissions between a subset of developed (e.g., U.S., EU, Japan) and
developing countries (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil). While our full
dataset contains 168 countries, we focus on a selected group of
representative nations to illustrate broader trends. Developed countries
have historically emitted more due to early industrialization, while
emissions in developing countries are rising alongside economic growth.
This comparison helps us assess whether developed nations are
successfully reducing emissions and how developing economies are
contributing to current global trends.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Count Number of unique countries
# unique(cleaned_data$Country)
# Define country groups
developed <- c("United States", "European Union (27)", "Japan", "Canada", "Australia", "Germany", "United Kingdom", "France")
developing <- c("India", "Indonesia", "Brazil", "South Africa", "Nigeria", "Iran", "Vietnam", "China")

# Assign development status
emissions_grouped <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% c(developed, developing)) %>%
  mutate(Development = case_when(
    Country %in% developed ~ "Developed",
    Country %in% developing ~ "Developing"
  ))

#Aggregate emissions by year and group
emissions_by_dev <- emissions_grouped %>% 
  group_by(Year, Development) %>% 
  summarise(Total_Emissions = sum(Emissions), .groups = "drop")

# Plot emissions trends by group
ggplot(emissions_by_dev, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Emissions, color = Development)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "GHG Emissions: Developed vs. Developing Countries(1990â2019)",
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Total Emissions (MtCO2e)", 
       color = "Development Criteria") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.2))
```

This plot shows the aggregated annual greenhouse gas emissions from
selected developed and developing countries between 1990 and 2019.
Emissions from developing countries increased dramatically over this
period, surpassing those of developed countries around 2007. While the
group includes multiple nations, the sharp rise is primarily driven by
China and India, whose rapid industrialization and economic growth
contributed significantly to the upward trend.

In contrast, emissions from developed countries remained relatively
stable or declined slightly, reflecting policy efforts, cleaner
technologies, and shifts away from carbon-intensive industries. This
divergence highlights how emerging economies are becoming key drivers in
global climate dynamics as contributors to emissions.

## Country Level Analysis

### GHG Emissions Trends: US vs. EU (1990â2019)

Over the past three decades, the United States and the European Union
have taken different paths in addressing GHG emissions. While both have
historically contributed significantly to global emissions, the EU has
demonstrated a more consistent downward trend, whereas the US has
experienced fluctuations.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Define European Union countries
EU_countries <- c("Albania", "Austria", "Belarus", "Belgium", "Bosnia and Herzegovina", 
                  "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", 
                  "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", 
                  "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Moldova", "Netherlands", 
                  "Norway", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania", "Serbia", "Slovenia", "Spain", 
                  "Sweden", "Switzerland", "United Kingdom")

# Aggregate emissions for EU
EU_emissions <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% EU_countries) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Emissions = sum(Emissions), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(Country = "European Union")

# Extract US emissions
US_emissions <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country == "United States")

# Combine US and EU data for comparison
us_eu_comparison <- bind_rows(US_emissions, EU_emissions)

# Plot emissions trends for US & EU
us_eu_trends <- us_eu_comparison %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Emissions, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "GHG Emissions Trends: US vs EU (1990â2019)",
       x = "Year", y = "Emissions (MtCO2e)") +
  theme_minimal()
print(us_eu_trends)
```

The European Union has steadily reduced emissions since the 1990s,
largely due to strict climate policies, the transition to renewable
energy sources, and the implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms. The
United States, in contrast, saw emissions rise in the 1990s and early
2000s, followed by a decline after 2008. The US reduction in emissions
can be attributed to a shift from coal to natural gas, improvements in
energy efficiency, and the expansion of renewable energy. However,
periodic increases indicate that the country still faces challenges in
fully transitioning to a low-carbon economy.

The key takeaway from this analysis is that the EU has been more
successful in decoupling economic growth from emissions, whereas the US,
despite progress, continues to show variability in its emissions trends.
This suggests that long-term policy stability and regulatory frameworks
play a crucial role in emissions reduction efforts.

### GHG Emissions Trends: China & India

China and India, as two of the fastest-growing economies, have shown
significant increases in emissions over the years. However, the
magnitude and pace of their emissions growth differ due to varying
levels of industrialization and energy dependency.

Emissions per unit of GDP serve as an indicator of how efficiently a
country produces economic output while managing carbon emissions. In
both China and India, emissions per GDP have shown a downward trend over
the past three decades, indicating improvements in energy efficiency and
industrial modernization.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
# Plot emissions trends for China & India (Industrial Expansion)
china_india <- c("China", "India")
china_india_trends <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% china_india) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Emissions, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "GHG Emissions Trends: China & India (1990â2019)",
       x = "Year", y = "Emissions (MtCO2e)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Emissions per GDP for China & India
china_india_gdp <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% china_india) %>%
  mutate(Emissions_per_GDP = Emissions / gdp) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Emissions_per_GDP, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Emissions per GDP: China vs India (1990â2019)",
       x = "Year", y = "Emissions per Unit GDP") +
  theme_minimal()

china_india_trends + china_india_gdp
```

Chinaâs emissions have surged dramatically since 2000, reflecting its
rapid industrialization, urban expansion, and reliance on coal as the
primary energy source. The country's economic boom, driven by
manufacturing and large-scale infrastructure projects, has made it the
worldâs largest emitter of GHGs. India, while also experiencing economic
growth, has shown a more gradual increase in emissions. Unlike China,
India has relied more on hydro and renewable energy sources,
contributing to a slower emissions growth rate.

The primary driver of Chinaâs emissions increase is its high reliance on
coal-powered electricity and export-driven industrial production. In
contrast, Indiaâs emissions trajectory suggests a more diversified
energy mix and a growing emphasis on renewable energy expansion. The key
takeaway here is that while both nations are on a high-emission
trajectory, India is progressing at a slower rate, potentially offering
a greater opportunity for early climate mitigation interventions.

China, despite having the highest total emissions, has made significant
progress in reducing its emissions intensity. This trend is largely
driven by technological advancements, shifts towards cleaner energy, and
government-led emissions reduction initiatives. India has also reduced
emissions per unit of GDP, but at a more gradual pace, reflecting its
ongoing industrial expansion and evolving energy policies.

The declining emissions intensity in both countries suggests that
economic growth does not necessarily have to be tied to increased
emissions. While Chinaâs rapid decline indicates a more aggressive
transition towards efficiency, Indiaâs slower yet consistent
improvements highlight the growing role of renewables and
energy-efficient technologies in shaping the future of emissions
management.

## The Impact of Climate Policies

Given the strong connection between economic growth and emissions,
international climate agreements have sought to mitigate emissions by
setting reduction targets and encouraging greener energy transitions.
Two of the most significant agreements in recent decades are the Kyoto
Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015). The effectiveness of
these agreements can be evaluated by comparing emissions levels before
and after their implementation.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(countrycode)
gdp <- read.csv("~/PSTAT 100/historical_emissions/data/gdp-per-capita.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
emissions <- read.csv("~/PSTAT 100/historical_emissions/data/historical_emissions.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
population <- read.csv("~/PSTAT 100/historical_emissions/data/population.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Reshape GDP and Population data
colnames(gdp)[5:ncol(gdp)] <- as.character(1960:(1959 + ncol(gdp) - 4))
colnames(population)[3:ncol(population)] <- as.character(1960:(1959 + ncol(population) - 2))

gdp_long <- gdp %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("19") | starts_with("20"),
                                  names_to = "Year", values_to = "GDP_per_capita")
population_long <- population %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("19") | starts_with("20"),
                                                names_to = "Year", values_to = "Population")

# Convert Year to numeric
gdp_long$Year <- as.numeric(gdp_long$Year)
population_long$Year <- as.numeric(population_long$Year)
emissions_long$Year <- as.numeric(emissions_long$Year)

# Merge datasets
merged_data <- gdp_long %>%
  inner_join(emissions_long, by = c("Country.Name" = "Country", "Year" = "Year")) %>%
  inner_join(population_long, by = c("Country.Name", "Year")) %>%
  select("Country.Name", "Year", "GDP_per_capita", "Emissions", "Population") %>%
  filter(!(Country.Name == "World"))

# Add Continent information
merged_data$Continent <- countrycode(merged_data$`Country.Name`, origin = "country.name", destination = "continent")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Analyze impact of climate policies
policy_years <- c("Kyoto Protocol" = 1997, "Paris Agreement" = 2015)
policy_analysis <- data.frame()
for (policy in names(policy_years)) {
  year <- policy_years[policy]
  before <- merged_data %>% filter(Year < year) %>% summarise(Mean_Emissions = mean(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE))
  after <- merged_data %>% filter(Year >= year) %>% summarise(Mean_Emissions = mean(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE))
  policy_analysis <- rbind(policy_analysis, data.frame(Policy = policy, Before = before$Mean_Emissions, After = after$Mean_Emissions))
}
policy_analysis %>% 
  kable()

```

The data reveals that neither agreement has resulted in an absolute
reduction in global emissions. Following the Kyoto Protocol, average
emissions increased from 163.96 $MtCO_2e$ before 1997 to 215.48
$MtCO_2e$ afterward, suggesting that the agreement did not lead to
meaningful reductions. This could be attributed to the lack of
participation from major emitters such as the United States, as well as
the fact that some countries were not required to meet binding emissions
targets.

Similarly, after the Paris Agreement in 2015, emissions continued to
rise, increasing from an average of 194.97 $MtCO_2e$ before the
agreement to 245.90 $MtCO_2e$ afterward. While the Paris Agreement set
ambitious targets, it relies on voluntary national commitments rather
than legally binding enforcement, making it difficult to ensure
compliance.

Overall, climate agreements have raised awareness and encouraged
emission reduction efforts, but their effectiveness has been limited by
enforcement challenges, economic constraints, and the continued
dominance of fossil fuels. Stronger policies, economic incentives, and
technological advancements will be necessary to achieve significant
reductions in global emissions. Without binding international
commitments and greater accountability, emissions are likely to continue
rising despite policy efforts.

# Summary and Discussion

### Summary Analysis

This project examined global greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2019,
with a particular focus on the relationship between emissions, economic
development, and population growth. By integrating emissions data with
GDP and population statistics, we revealed how industrial expansion and
demographic trends have influenced the trajectory of global
emissions.Between 1990 and 2019, total global GHG emissions increased
from approximately 33,000 $MtCO_2e$ to about 50,000 $MtCO_2e$, showing a
sharp and consistent upward trend. This rise was especially steep after
the year 2000, a period that aligned with China's industrial expansion
and integration into the global economy. In 2000, China emitted just
over 4,000 $MtCO_2e$, but by 2019, this number had surpassed 12,000
$MtCO_2e$, tripling in less than two decades. India also saw emissions
grow steadily, from under 1,000 $MtCO_2e$ in 1990 to about 3,000
$MtCO_2e$ by 2019. On the economic front, global GDP also experienced
significant growth. Total world GDP increased from about \$44 trillion
in 1990 to over \$124 trillion by 2019 (in current US dollars). Much of
this growth was driven by developing economies.

Despite leading the world in total emissions, China made substantial
progress in reducing emissions intensity. In 1990, China emitted around
700 $MtCO_2e$ per unit of GDP, but by 2019, this number had dropped to
under 150 $MtCO_2e$ per unit GDP, a decline of nearly 80%. India showed
similar but slower progress, reducing emissions intensity from about 240
to 180 $MtCO_2e$ per unit GDP over the same period. These changes
suggest that both countries became significantly more efficient in how
they generate economic output relative to emissions.

Our comparison of developed and developing nations revealed stark
contrasts. Developed countries such as the United States and European
Union members have maintained or reduced their emissions. For example,
the United Statesâ emissions remained relatively flat from the
mid-2000s, hovering around 6,000 $MtCO_2e$, and showed a slight decline
after 2008. In contrast, emissions from developing countries have
increased significantly. This is especially clear in our analysis of
aggregated emissions, where developing countries surpassed developed
ones in total GHG emissions around 2007, driven primarily by industrial
growth in Asia.

Although international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and
Paris Agreement (2015) were implemented during this period, global
average emissions continued to rise. After the Kyoto Protocol, average
emissions increased from 163.95 $MtCO_2e$ to over 215.47 $MtCO_2e$, and
after the Paris Agreement, from 194.97 $MtCO_2e$ to more than 245.90
$MtCO_2e$. These trends highlight the difficulty of translating
international commitments into substantial emission reductions,
especially when agreements lack enforcement or global buy-in.

In essence, while many countries have made progress in emissions
efficiency, total global emissions have continued to climb.
High-emitting nations like China and India are becoming more
carbon-efficient, but their total output continues to rise due to
economic and population growth. Developed nations have stabilized or
slightly reduced emissions, but they must continue to lead in innovation
and support. Equally important is the need for equity: vulnerable
nations facing climate threats need both financial and technological
support to adapt.

### Limitations of the Analysis

One of the primary limitations of this study is the absence of post-2019
emissions data. The dataset, sourced from Climate Watch, only includes
data up to 2019, which restricts the ability to analyze more recent
trends in greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2019, several significant
global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had profound
effects on industrial activity, transportation, and energy consumption,
all of which are key drivers of emissions. Without updated data, it is
difficult to determine whether the pre-2019 trends identified in this
study have continued, reversed, or changed due to new policies, economic
disruptions, or technological advancements. This gap in the dataset
limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of recent climate
policies and mitigation strategies, making it necessary for future
research to incorporate post-2019 data for a more comprehensive
analysis.

Another key limitation is the challenge of distinguishing correlation
from causation in emissions trends. While the analysis identifies
statistical relationships between emissions reductions and economic
indicators such as GDP growth, policy changes, and energy transitions,
it does not establish direct causal links between specific policies and
changes in emissions. Many factors influence emissions trends, including
global economic conditions, advancements in renewable energy
technologies, and variations in industrial activity. Without more
detailed policy-level data and controlled study designs, it is difficult
to determine the precise impact of individual policies on emissions
reductions. Future research could address this limitation by employing
more sophisticated econometric models, conducting case studies on
specific policy interventions, or utilizing natural experiments to
isolate policy effects.

These limitations highlight the need for continued data collection and
methodological advancements to improve understanding of emissions trends
and their underlying causes. Incorporating post-2019 data would provide
a clearer picture of how emissions have evolved in response to recent
global developments, while more robust analytical techniques could help
establish clearer causal relationships between policy measures and
emissions outcomes. Addressing these gaps would enable more effective
policymaking and contribute to the broader effort of mitigating climate
change.

### Future Research Directions

A key priority for future research is extending the analysis to include
emissions data beyond 2019. The current dataset limits insights into
recent trends, making it difficult to evaluate the impact of global
events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, advancements in renewable energy,
and evolving climate policies. Incorporating post-2019 data would
provide a more up-to-date understanding of emissions patterns and allow
researchers to assess whether previously observed trends have continued
or shifted. This extended analysis could help identify the long-term
effects of economic disruptions and policy interventions, offering
valuable insights for future climate action. Additionally, with many
countries setting net-zero targets for 2050 or earlier, tracking
emissions trends in the most recent years would provide a clearer
picture of global progress toward these goals.

Another critical area for future research is examining the interplay
between emissions, GDP, and human development indices (HDIs). While
economic growth has historically been linked to rising emissions, the
relationship is not always straightforward, as factors such as energy
efficiency improvements, policy measures, and technological advancements
can decouple growth from emissions. By analyzing the connections between
emissions, GDP, and HDI, researchers can better understand how economic
development influences environmental sustainability. This approach could
also shed light on the trade-offs and synergies between economic growth
and emissions reduction strategies, particularly in developing nations
where both economic expansion and sustainability goals must be balanced.
A deeper investigation into this relationship could inform policies that
promote sustainable development without compromising economic prosperity
or human well-being.

Addressing these research directions would significantly enhance our
understanding of global emissions trends and their socioeconomic
drivers. Expanding the dataset to include post-2019 emissions and
integrating economic and human development indicators into the analysis
would provide a more comprehensive picture of the factors shaping global
climate change. These efforts would not only contribute to academic
research but also support policymakers in designing more effective
climate strategies that align with both environmental and economic
objectives.
